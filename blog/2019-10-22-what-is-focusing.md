On my website I state I am a ‘focusing-oriented’ counsellor - so what is ‘focusing’?

At its simplest, focusing is paying attention to something you are experiencing, in the present moment, that is not yet in words and is about something in your life.

Let’s break this down a bit….

Paying attention to is listening, which means pausing, waiting (because you’re giving attention to something rather than talking further about it…). So you pause and wait and see what it is that you’re aware of, or start to become aware of.

Then there is ‘something you’re experiencing’ that is ‘not yet in words’..... This includes feelings, sensations in the body, images, memories or other situations in your life that come to mind, gestures, sounds (eg songs and lyrics), gestures and movements…. (this list is not exhaustive). What we are paying attention to is a more right-brain experience which tends to be in images, metaphors, poetry. The right side of the brain also has more connections with what’s going on in the body (eg the gut and ‘gut feelings’), so what is ‘known’ or ‘felt’ in the body links with the brain and becomes put into symbols and language. 

In the present moment means we pay attention to what is being felt and experienced NOW - rather than our thoughts about what happened last week. We can take something that has happened, this is very important, but crucially we see how we feel about it right now in the present moment. This changes it from ‘talking about’ a situation that has affected us, and seeing how it is for us now.

At any time we can ask inwardly how we feel about something. Or we can sense how we are feeling and out of that what it’s about will emerge (eg if we are feeling anxious we can ask, inwardly, what it is that is getting so anxious).
