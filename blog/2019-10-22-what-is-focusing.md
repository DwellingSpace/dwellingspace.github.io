On my website I state I am a ‘focusing-oriented’ counsellor - so what is ‘focusing’?

At its simplest, focusing is paying attention to something you are experiencing, in the present moment, that is not yet in words and is about something in your life.

Let’s break this down a bit….

**'Paying attention to'** is listening, which means pausing, waiting (because you’re giving attention to something rather than talking further about it…). So you pause and wait and see what it is that you’re aware of, or start to become aware of.

Then there is **'something you’re experiencing'** that is **'not yet in words'**..... This includes feelings, sensations in the body, images, memories or other situations in your life that come to mind, gestures, sounds (eg songs and lyrics), gestures and movements…. (this list is not exhaustive). What we are paying attention to is a more right-brain experience which tends to be in images, metaphors, sensations, gestures.... The right side of the brain also has more connections with what’s going on in the body (eg the gut and ‘gut feelings’), so what is ‘known’ or ‘felt’ in the body links with the brain and becomes put into symbols and language. 

**'In the present moment'** means we pay attention to what is being felt and experienced NOW - rather than our thoughts about what happened. We can talk about something that has happened and affected us, this is very important, but crucially we see how we feel about it right now in the present moment. 'How does this whole situation feel, now'?

At any time we can ask inwardly how we feel about something. Or we can sense how we are feeling and out of that what it’s about will emerge (eg if we are feeling anxious we can ask, inwardly, what it is that is getting so anxious).

An important thing to know is that when we ask inwardly how a problematic issue in our life is, we may intially find that there is nothing we are aware of (other than our thoughts). How something feels, eg in our body, or how our right-brain-body might bring up an image, or a memory, doesn’t come quickly like thoughts about our life do. We can easily think about our situations and find words. It can be disconcerting to wait without knowing what to expect. We’re sitting with the unknown. What can be helpful, once we have paused, is to have a listener with us who can say back to us what we are saying, so we can keep at it rather than give up because it is difficult, unfamiliar or embarrassing. 

Another really helpful thing to do is to say ‘I’m feeling (or sensing, or noticing) something…..’ for example we might feel uncomfortable somewhere in the middle of our body but there is no way of describing it, or it might be very very slight and easily missed. All this is completely normal in focusing and on the right track. We can say 'I'm feeling something here, in my middle' (and maybe point to the body). Part of the trick is learning to stay with what seems vague and unpromising at first and wait as it develops.(Incidentally this is how 'focusing' got its name - like something coming into focus - becoming clearer as we wait and stay with it, keeping it company with friendly attention). 

This is another crucial aspect of learning to do focusing - we give anything within us, and that emerges, a friendly, curious, welcoming, non-judgemental, accepting attention.

And here’s me giving a demonstration of what focusing can look like.
