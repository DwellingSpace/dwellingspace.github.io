              <p>I’m <b>Alison</b> and I’m a qualified and experienced counsellor working in
              London N16. I work with adults, one-to-one, in private practice, on an open-ended basis. This means you decide how long is right for you. I can also work with you online, using software similar to Skype.</p> 
			  
			  <p>You can contact me by phone, text, email, or the contact form here. I look forward to talking with you. </p><br />

              <h2>How I can help you</h2>

              <p>My approach is <b>person-centred</b> and <b>focusing-oriented</b>. I will work with you to create a safe space so you can talk about whatever needs attention right now. Previous clients have told me they were able to share embarrassing, difficult, distressing or shameful experiences with me and find relief. My primary concern is that you are fully heard, accepted and valued ‘just as you are’.</p>

              <p>Being fully heard can be healing in itself. It can help you make sense of troubling or distressing experiences and feelings and move forward in your life. </p>

                <h3>Focusing-oriented</h3>

                <p>Focusing is a powerful yet gentle way to bring about personal change. It is particularly helpful when you don't know why you're unhappy or when the same difficult feelings or unwanted patterns of behaviour keep repeating. It can help when feelings are scary or overwhelming, as well as when we have lost touch with how we feel. You can read more here. </p>

          <h2>How we can work together</h2>

          <blockquote><i>Every bad feeling is a potential energy to a right way of
          being, if you give it space to move towards its rightness. </i><b>Gene Gendlin</b></blockquote>
		  
		  <p>My own experience as a client, and my work as a counsellor, has shown me that there is an inner sense of what is right and true for each of us. This is a very individual thing. The problem is that negative or painful experiences can lead us to lose sight of this inner compass, leading to painful feelings of depression, anxiety, fear, overwhelm, hopelessness, frustration, or conflict. We feel unable to live our life as we would like.</p>
       
          <p>As your counsellor, I will work with you to find this inner resource so you can navigate your life with less stress, follow what is right for you, and find relief.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
		
		<h2>Making sense</h2>

			<p>However stuck or unhappy we feel, however weird, scary or deeply distressing our experiences, these make very good sense when we understand them as a natural reaction to what life has thrown at us. This includes childhood experiences, losses, painful dilemmas in adult life, as well as the social and economic conditions we are living in, or society’s view of how we should be.</p>		

        </div>

        <div class="section blue">
		
		<h2>Focusing sessions</h2>	
	
			<p>I am currently training to become a qualified Focusing Practitioner with the British Focusing Association. I am happy to offer you focusing sessions at a cost of £20 per 50 minute session. This can be a one-off, or you can book more sessions with me. This is something that is separate from therapy. Learning focusing for yourself means you will then have this as a self-help and healing tool. </p>

        </div>
		
		<div class="section">
		
		<h2>Why counselling?</h2>
		
		<p>Some reasons people come to counselling are: depression, anxiety, feeling unfulfilled, relationship difficulties, parenting issues, bereavement, childhood abuse including sexual abuse, loneliness, problems related to work or the lack of it, addictions of all kinds, overwhelming experiences, hearing voices, sexuality, gender identity, bullying, growing older.... the list could go on a long time.... You may also want counselling because you are experiencing life in ways that are hard to describe - feeling stuck, feeling life has no meaning, feeling numb, feeling reactive to everything, being in conflict with other people or in conflict within yourself, having difficulty making decisions, feeling unfulfilled. You may feel that there is more that you want in life but don’t know how to find it. </p>

          <h2>Contact information and fees</h2>

          <p>If you would like to talk with me about how I can help you, or you want to ask some questions about counselling, I suggest a free initial chat over the phone (or online). If you would then like to book a session, we can explore together what you would like from counselling, and take it from there. You can then book further sessions with me. All of this is at your pace. </p>
		  
		  <p>I charge £50 for a 50-minute session. I also offer longer sessions if wanted. </p>

          <p>Please contact me at <a href="mailto:dwellingspacecounselling@gmail.com">dwellingspacecounselling@gmail.com</a> or xxxxx xxxxxx or use the contact form below, and I will be in touch (usually within 24 hours).
