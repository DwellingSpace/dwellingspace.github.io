      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>I’m <b>Alison Thorpe,</b> an experienced counsellor working in Dalston, E8 and Stoke Newington, N16. I also work online, using Zoom and VSee. I work with adults on an open-ended basis, so you decide how long is right for you.</p>

      <p>My approach is <b>person-centred</b> and <b>focusing-oriented</b>. I will work with you to create a safe space where you can talk about whatever you need to. </p>

      <p>It's easy to <a href="#contact">contact me.</a> Together we can start a conversation about what’s happening for you, what you need and how we can work together. </p><br />

      <h2>Counselling with me</h2>

      <p>We start with where you are. There is no requirement to be anything other than how you are, at this point in your life. </p>

      <p>Painful feelings and reactions can get in the way of living. When someone listens and is fully present with us, we can listen to what hurts inside. Learning to hear ourselves, with compassion, accompanied by a caring other can be a very healing process.</p>

      <p>New ways forward emerge, you become more able to cope, make decisions you couldn’t before, or express yourself as once you could not. It may be surprising to discover what has been holding you back.</p>

        <p>We all have an inner knowing of what is right for us. I will work with you to find your inner resources so you can navigate your life with less stress. </p>

  <h2>Why counselling?</h2>

  <p><b>Making sense : </b>however stuck or unhappy we feel, however weird, scary or deeply distressing our experiences, these make very good sense when we understand them as a natural reaction to what life has thrown at us. This includes childhood experiences, losses, painful dilemmas in adult life, as well as the social and economic conditions we are living in, or society’s view of how we should be.</p>

  <p>I've helped people with:</p>

  <div class="list-cols">
  <ul>
  <li>depression and feeling low</li>
  <li>self-criticism</li>
  <li>anxiety</li>
  <li>relationship difficulties</li>
  <li>parenting issues</li>
  <li>bereavement</li>
  <li>childhood trauma including sexual abuse</li>
  <li>loneliness and social isolation</li>
  <li>discrimination</li>
  <li>work or the lack of work</li>
  <li>gender identity</li>
  <li>low self esteem, lack of confidence</li>
  <li>addictions</li>
  <li>hearing voices</li>
  <li>bullying</li>
  <li>self-harm</li>
  <li>growing older</li>
  </ul></div>

  <p>You may also want counselling because you are experiencing life in ways that are hard to describe - feeling stuck, feeling life has no meaning, feeling numb, feeling reactive to everything, being in conflict with other people or in conflict within yourself, having difficulty making decisions, feeling unfulfilled. You may feel that there is more that you want in life but don’t know how to find it.</p>
