## Focusing-oriented

<blockquote>Every bad feeling is potential energy toward a more right way of being if you give it space to move toward its rightness. Gene Gendlin</blockquote>

Giving gentle attention to how our **body** experiences our life situations can really get to the **heart** of what is stuck or unchanging, and bring a huge amount of **healing**. We can then live with a new freedom.

Our feelings express themselves in and through our body. For example, stress might be felt in the throat, or anxiety in the belly, grief or overwhelming sadness in our chest and heart. I can help you pay gentle and friendly attention to these places in you that might be asking for attention and care, and the opportunity to tell their story.

Here's a video of someone focusing :)

## Trauma

Focusing is particularly effective in healing unresolved trauma. This can be from childhood abuse (sexual, physical, emotional, neglect), as well as all sorts of other traumas and issues, including addictions. I am writing about healing from trauma and dissociation for the blog section of this website. [Please contact me](/#contact) if you would like to talk through how focusing-oriented therapy and focusing can help your recovery.

## Focusing with me

If you would like to work with me to **learn focusing** as a **self-help** practice, or you would like to deepen your focusing experience, you are very welcome to contact me to discuss what you need. Focusing can work in person or over video link.

I am also very open to supporting your self-discovery through **art and imagery** during counselling or focusing sessions.
